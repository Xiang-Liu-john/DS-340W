## Project Title
Differentiating AI-Composed and Human-Composed R&B Music Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Description
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to distinguish between R&B music composed by artificial intelligence and that composed by humans. By leveraging advanced feature extraction techniques and machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines and deep learning, this research aims to enhance the personalization of music consumption and provide insights into the future of AI in music creation.

## Installation
Just download the datasets for both AI-composed and Human-composed R&B Music, then download the .ipynb file.

## Usage
Run the code in .ipynb file.

## Data
The dataset consists of 200 R&B songs, divided equally between AI-generated and human-created tracks.
